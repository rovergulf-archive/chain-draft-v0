## 7 Jul 2021

### Added
- Added [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)
- I have lost a lot of time at trying to implement common database interface,
  only after lot of spent time I get that it is not even good fits the idea
  of separate interfaces and storages. It would be described in further docs:
  this chain would be as disturbed, as you do not need to have the whole chain backup. 
  Only the data compared with your node and accounts registered at network.
