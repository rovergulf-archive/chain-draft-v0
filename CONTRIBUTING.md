## Reporting bugs and creating issues

Reporting bugs is one of the best ways to contribute.

However, a good bug report has some very specific qualities, so please, 
check if there is already no [existing one](https://github.com/rovergulf/chain/issues) 
before submitting a bug report or creating a [pull request](https://github.com/rovergulf/chain/pulls).

## Contribution flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a topic branch from where to base the contribution. This is usually master.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Make sure commit messages are in the proper format (see below).
- Push changes in a topic branch to a personal fork of the repository.
- Submit a pull request to rovergulf/rbn.
- The PR must receive a LGTM from at least one of maintainers found 
  in the [repository contributors](https://github.com/rovergulf/chain/graphs/contributors).

Thanks for contributing!
