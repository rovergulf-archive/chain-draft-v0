const (
	Nether = 1   // smallest denomination of Coin, is an acronym for Network, Etherium and Rovergulf
	Coin   = 1e9 // One "Nether Coin" or "Rovergulf Coin"
)

//
// When I thought about currency naming it was simple,
// cause Rovergulf is canonically mythic place â€“ a bay in the ocean, with ships, pirates, mythic resources
// and probably some magic, as well space technologies invented
// So Nether represents for me something like an iron ore resource,
// but its original english language value fits well, and still may sound cool in other languages
// So "Nether Coin" represents Rovergulf Native Token which abbreviation RNT sounds not badass enough
// As well Rovergulf Coin would be implemented in a second/supportive way
