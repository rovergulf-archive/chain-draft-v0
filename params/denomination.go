// When I thought about currency naming it was simple,
// cause Rovergulf is canonically mythic place â€“ a bay in the ocean, with ships, pirates, mythic resources
// and probably some magic, as well space technologies invented
// So Nether represents for me something like an iron ore resource,
// but its original english language value fits well, and still may sound cool in other languages
// So "Raftel" represents Rovergulf Native Token which is accent spelling of "Laugh tale"
// and refers to "One Piece" written by Eiichiro Oda (details on: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eiichiro_Oda)
